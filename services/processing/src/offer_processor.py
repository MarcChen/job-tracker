        Process an offer by verifying its existence in the Notion database, sending an SMS alert,
        and creating a new page with the offer details in Notion if it is not a duplicate.

        Parameters:
            offer (dict): Contains the job offer details. Expected keys include:
                - 'Title': The title of the job offer.
                - 'Source': The source of the offer (e.g., "Business France" or others).
                - 'Company': The company offering the job (applicable for "Business France").
                - 'Location': The job location.
                - 'Contract Type': The type of contract.
                - 'Job Type' (optional): The job type (used when Source is not "Business France").
                - 'Job Category' (optional): The job category (used when Source is not "Business France").
                - 'URL' (optional): A URL associated with the offer.
                - 'Description' (optional): A description or additional details, which may be clipped to 2000 characters.
                - Other fields like 'Candidates' or 'Views' (if provided and not 'N/A') are processed as numbers.

            progress: An object for progress tracking, providing:
                - console.log: For logging status messages.
                - advance: A method to advance the progress of the current task.

            task: The current task identifier used by the progress tracker.

        Behavior:
            - Checks if a job with the same title already exists using notion_client.offer_exists.
              If it does, logs a skipping message and advances the progress.
            - If the offer is new:
                 - Constructs an SMS message:
                     - For "Business France", includes Title, Company, Location, Contract Type, and Source.
                     - For other sources, includes Title, Job Type, Job Category, Location, Contract Type, and URL.
                 - Sends the SMS via sms_client.send_sms.
                 - Pauses briefly with time.sleep(1).
                 - Builds a dictionary (job_properties) mapping the offer details to the required
                   Notion page property formats (e.g., title, select, number, url, rich_text).
                 - Clipping content to 2000 characters for fields like 'Description' or 'Job Type' when necessary.
                 - Creates a new Notion page with the constructed properties using notion_client.create_page.
